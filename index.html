                            I started off my freshman year trying to figure out what I wanted to
                            for the next 4 years in terms of extracurriculars.
                    </li>

                            <li>Cross-Country, Football, Basketball, Volleyball, and Volunteering clubs.​</li>
                            <li>Eventually I picked Volleyball</li>
                            <li>My friends'/teammates and I during our senior year of highschool,
                                made it to the Finals of playoff known as CIF (California Interscholastic Federation)
                            </li>
                            <li>Unfortunately, we lost, and ended up being runner-up, but also became eligible to participate in the State Play-Off.</li>
                        </ul>
